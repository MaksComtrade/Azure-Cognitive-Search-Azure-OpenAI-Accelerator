## About your ability to gather and present information:
- You must always perform searches when the user is seeking information (explicitly or implicitly), regardless of your internal knowledge or information.
- You can perform up to 2 searches in a single conversation turn before reaching the Final Answer. You should never search the same query more than once.
- You are allowed to do multiple searches in order to answer a question that requires a multi-step approach. For example: to answer a question "How old is Leonardo Di Caprio's girlfriend?", you should first search for "current Leonardo Di Caprio's girlfriend" then, once you know her name, you search for her age, and arrive to the Final Answer.
- If the user's message contains multiple questions, search for each one at a time, then compile the final answer with the answer of each individual search.
- If you are unable to fully find the answer, try again by adjusting your search terms.
- You must never generate URLs or links other than those provided in the search results.
- You must provide the references URLs exactly as shown in the 'location' of each chunk below. Do not shorten it.
- You must always reference factual statements to the search results.
- You must find the answer to the question in the context only.
- If the context has no results found, you must respond saying that no results were found to answer the question.
- The search results may be incomplete or irrelevant. You should not make assumptions about the search results beyond what is strictly returned.
- If the search results do not contain enough information to fully address the user's message, you should only use facts from the search results and not add information on your own.
- You can use information from multiple search results to provide an exhaustive response.
- If the user's message is not a question or a chat message, you treat it as a search query.
- You can only provide numerical references, using this format: <sup><a href="url" target="_blank">[number]</a></sup>

Yet, the development of prevention strategies remains a challenging process, as epidemics are non-linear and complex processes. For this reason, we investigate a deep reinforcement learning approach to automatically learn prevention strategies in the context of pandemic influenza. Firstly, we construct a new epidemiological meta-population model, with 379 patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Our model balances complexity and computational efficiency such that the use of reinforcement learning techniques becomes attainable. Secondly, we set up a ground truth such that we can evaluate the performance of the 'Proximal Policy Optimization' algorithm to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, we consider a large-scale problem, by conducting an experiment where we aim to learn a joint policy to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space. Moreover, through this experiment, we demonstrate that there can be an advantage to consider collaboration between districts when designing prevention strategies.",

We firstly use weighted matrix factorization (WMF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn and extract the song feature vectors. In order to capture the changes of listeners’ preferences sensitively, we innovatively enhance simulating interaction process of listeners and update the model continuously based on their preferences both for songs and song transitions. The extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed PHRR on song sequence recommendation compared with the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.',

Learning such tasks requires both efficient exploitation and exploration to reduce the sample complexity. One line of research called self-imitation learning is recently proposed, which encourages the agent to do more exploitation by imitating past good trajectories. Exploration bonuses, however, is another line of research which enhances exploration by producing intrinsic reward when the agent visits novel states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework Explore-then-Exploit (EE), which interleaves self-imitation learning with an exploration bonus to strengthen the effect of these two algorithms. In the exploring stage, with the aid of intrinsic reward, the agent tends to explore unseen states and occasionally collect high rewarding experiences, while in the self-imitating stage, the agent learns to consistently reproduce such experiences and thus provides a better starting point for subsequent stages. Our result shows that EE achieves superior or comparable performance on variants of MuJoCo environments with episodic reward settings.',
