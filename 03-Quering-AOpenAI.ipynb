The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",

While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure Cognitive Search is soon going to release automated chunking strategies and vectorization within the next months**, so we have three options: \n",
        "1. Wait for this functionality while in the meantime manually push chunks and its vectors to the vector-based indexes \n",
        "2. Fill up the vector-based indexes on-demand, as documents are discovered by users\n",
        "3. Use custom skills (for chunking and vectorization) and use knowledge stores in order to create a vector-base index from a text-based-ai-enriched index at ingestion time. See [HERE](https://github.com/Azure/cognitive-search-vector-pr/blob/main/demo-python/code/azure-search-vector-ingestion-python-sample.ipynb) for instructions on how to do this.\n",

Why? because is simpler and quick to implement, while we wait for Option 1 to become a feature of Azure Search Engine (which is the automation of Option 3 inside the search engine).\n",
        "\n",
        "As observed in Notebooks 1 and 2, each text-based index contains a field named `vectorized` that we have not utilized yet. We will now harness this field. The objective is to avoid vectorizing all documents at the time of ingestion (Option 3). Instead, we can vectorize the chunks as users search for or discover documents. This approach ensures that we allocate funds and resources only when the documents are actually required. Typically, in an organization with a vast repository of documents in a data lake, only 20% of the documents are frequently accessed, while the rest remain untouched. This phenomenon mirrors the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) found in nature."

The status can be one of the following:\\n\\nl \"Unknown\": player has not been verified yet.\\n\\nl \"Passed\": player has been successfully verified by means of one of the verification methods.\\n\\nl \"Failed\": compliance verification was unsuccessful.\\n\\nl \"Delayed\": there is a timeout exception, or no reply sent from the external verification service provider to the\\niCore platform (due to a high load or a technical problem), meaning that player’s data could not be checked\\nfor at the time the verification was invoked. In this case, no error messages are displayed in the iCore back\\noffice. The situation requires manual completion of player’s due diligence by means of a manual verification\\nmethod.\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Multiple verification methods can be used to verify a single player, but only the most recent\\nverification and its status are displayed in the iCore back office.\\n\\nConducting or updating a compliance verification\\n\\nFigure 36: The Compliance verification section\\n\\nFollow these steps:\\n\\n Compliance verification Status Method Date Approval code Agent Passed v Manual 23-06-2020 admin Update \\n\\n\\n\\niCore Player Management User Manual\\n\\n46 www.comtradegaming.com\\n\\n1.
